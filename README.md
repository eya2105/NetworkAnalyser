# NertworkAnalyser
NetworkAnalyser is a Python tool for monitoring and analyzing Wi-Fi networks. It displays signal strength, estimates distances, visualizes data, and connects to the strongest network. Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS. Ideal for real-time network analysis and performance tracking.
Features:
Wi-Fi Signal Monitoring: Continuously monitors and displays the signal strength of nearby Wi-Fi networks.
Signal Strength Visualization: Visualizes Wi-Fi signal strength over time with real-time graph updates.
Network Discovery: Discovers available Wi-Fi networks and displays their SSID and signal strength.
Distance Estimation: Estimates the distance to Wi-Fi networks based on signal strength using the path-loss model.
Automatic Network Connection: Connects to the strongest Wi-Fi network based on signal strength.
Cross-platform Support: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python packages: subprocess, platform, matplotlib
